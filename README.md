# Simple Delivery Address

Easy to use, language agnostic templates for combining address parts into a full address. This project is much like OpenCages's [address-formatting](https://github.com/OpenCageData/address-formatting) but with a focus on delivery and therefore includes

## Address parts

```yaml
unit: String
house_name: String
street_number: String
street_name: String
city: String
county: String
state: String
country: String
postalcode: String
```

For example,

```yaml
unit: Flat 9
house_name: Servite Houses
street_number: 10
street_name: Rectory Road
city: Beckenham
county: Greater London
state: England
country: United Kingdom
postalcode: BR3 1HZ
```
